The base code for this project was adapted from Nicholas Renotte. While the original concept and code were used as a foundation, several modifications were made to suit the specific functionality and features of this User Interface.

## Demo üé¨

## The Code files: üìÑ
**app.py:** creates a user-friendly graphical interface for generating images using the Stable Diffusion model. It allows users to input a text prompt, select artistic styles, adjust resolution, and toggle between dark and light themes. The script integrates a pre-trained Stable Diffusion pipeline for image generation, displays the output within the application, and saves the generated image locally.

## Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è
**GUI Setup:** CustomTkinter is used to build a modern and user-friendly interface for image generation.

**Prompt Input and Validation:** The user can enter a prompt, which is validated to ensure it is not empty.

**Style Selection:** Users can select from predefined artistic styles to influence the generated image (e.g., "Realism", "Cartoon", "Abstract", "Fantasy", "Cyberpunk").

**Resolution Control:** The image resolution is adjustable via a slider (from 256px to 1024px)..

**Stable Diffusion Model:** A pre-trained Stable Diffusion model is loaded and used for image generation.

**Background Processing:** The image generation process is run in a separate thread to prevent UI freezes.

**Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented for user input and model issues.

**Image Display and Saving:** The generated image is displayed in the app and saved locally.

**Appearance Mode Toggle:** The user can switch between light and dark modes for the app's interface.

**Multithreading:** Ensures smooth UI interaction during image generation.
